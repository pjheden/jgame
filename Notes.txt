To do:
1. Rebuild the program, GameController, Bullet class, GameLayer
2. Cowboy shoot back
	- difficult
	- draw cowboy bullet
3. Use the global variable for screen size (_screenSize)
4. HighScore
5. settings
6. create multiple scenes
	-i.e: MainMenu scene, Settings scene, game scene etc
8. Add railroad building for Workers

Note:
1. try Eclipse to run HelloWorld on android
	- Compiling works through cmd, but not the emulator
	- Check cocos2d-x emulator guide and try again
2. Add all files to Appication.mk or Android.mk
3. Move all the files to Classes

Ideas:
1. Variable to keep track on which level we are
2. Have a function which changes level

CollisionBitmasks:
1: Player
2: Workers, Cowboys
3: Arrows
4: bullets
5: leftwall

Type:
1: Indian / arrow
2: Cowboy / bullet
3: workers

int to char* for CCLOG reasons:
std::string s2 = std::to_string( distance );
char const *pchar2 = s2.c_str();

Studying EarthWarriod3D (github):
GameLayer controls the game track of the game. -------
init: creates player, inits bulletcontroller, enemycontroller. Starts schedule for gameMaster
gameMaster: checks if player is dead, check if it has to spawn new enemies, iniate a schedule for enemy shooting

Bullets class
to init methods, one for creating cowboy bullet and other for indian bullet

Gamecontroller
Calls bullets class to create bullets, keeps track of the bullets in a list
remove bullets

Player class
Player::shoot()
{
	BulletController:SpawnBullet();
}

07/23/2015:
DONE 1.Fix cowboys shooting
*Had negative velocity
DONE 2. Arrow shooting bugged
*When arrows are declared as bullets and its functions are called they use the
super classes function, thus it the type and speed values was unset


07/08/2015:
DONE 1. Flytta physicsbody (PLayer, Cowboy, Worker) till HelloWorld.cpp

DONE 3. add cowboy and worker animations

DONE 6. cowboys and workers should be removed if they leave the screen (left side)
	- Can be done by putting a wall with a collisionbitmask ?

DONE 7. Turn off sprite rotation


6/25/2015:
Note to self:
to create a runable win32 file, use the cocos run command ( cocos run -s path -p win32)

6/24/2015:
	Collisions fixed
	Started setting up a general skeleton of a game, i.e. making Player & enemy classes,
	setting up for animations.
	Player class finished
	Main menu finished

6/22/2015:
	Fixed movement, and bullet spawn position
	To do: Fix collisions ( player with seals and bullets with seals, bullets with player? )

6/21/2015:
	Started making a sealHunter - clone
