To do:
0. Make it work on android emulator - - -- - - 
0.1 Change the menu from labels to MenuItemSprite
	-see:  https://github.com/chukong/EarthWarrior3D/blob/master/Classes/MainMenuScene.cpp



1. fix the changes or nrOfArrows			**Need wifi, to check the guide on how to do it
	-Idéa: Make an invisible wall that the arrows hit but the cowboys can walk through,
		remove arrows on collision instead of callback after MoveTo. Make Cowboy bullets
		also go through cowboys. Same wall on the leftside for the cowboys bullets
	-2idea: can you cancel the callback?
	
-	-3idea best idea: make a wall behind player and a wall behind where cowboys spawn that catch and deletes arrows/bullets, molto bene.
	-When it's fixed, uncomment nrOfArrows -= 1 in Gamecontroller:erase()

2. add cowboy walking animation  **need wifi, Henke skulle skicka cowboy.plisk
3. add indian shooting animation?

5. settings slider		**need wifi, check bookmark

9. HighScore -add name to the score

10. Small animation at main menu, arrow that fly across the screen and is burning using cocos2d-x particle

Remember:
1. Add all files to Appication.mk or Android.mk
2. Move all the files to Classes


CollisionBitmasks:
1: Player
2: Workers, Cowboys
3: Arrows
4: bullets
5: leftwall
6: rightwall

CategoryBitMasks:
1: player
2: Workers, Cowboys
4: bullets
5: testwall

Type:
1: Indian / arrow
2: Cowboy / bullet
3: workers

int to char* for CCLOG reasons:
std::string s2 = std::to_string( distance );
char const *pchar2 = s2.c_str();




Project in android:
1. cd projectfolder
2. cocos compile -p android (it's okay if it gives error as long as it's not from my code)
3. open in eclipse
4. start emulator
4. run as android project



07/23/2015:
DONE 1.Fix cowboys shooting
*Had negative velocity
DONE 2. Arrow shooting bugged
*When arrows are declared as bullets and its functions are called they use the
super classes function, thus it the type and speed values was unset


07/08/2015:
DONE 1. Flytta physicsbody (PLayer, Cowboy, Worker) till HelloWorld.cpp

DONE 3. add cowboy and worker animations

DONE 6. cowboys and workers should be removed if they leave the screen (left side)
	- Can be done by putting a wall with a collisionbitmask ?

DONE 7. Turn off sprite rotation


6/25/2015:
Note to self:
to create a runable win32 file, use the cocos run command ( cocos run -s path -p win32)

6/24/2015:
